# UniversityRecommendations

With over 25,000 higher education institutions world wide, high school seniors applying to college have so many option to choose from. This program analyzes the list of top 200 colleges in North America and returns university recommendations tailored to a user based on a various metrics such as student enrollment, campus setting, campus location, academic calendar, and type of university. Students can enter their preferences on this application, and our program will run our algorithm and provide personalized reccomendations for each user. There is also a feature to view common trends and statistics for each university based on certain attributes. Some correlations include tution to country rank, tuition to user's income level, and country rank to internal schoools. 

All University Data is web scraped from the following website (https://www.4icu.org/top-universities-north-america/) using JSoup. The reccomendation and graph algorithms operate on a data set scraped from the site with the following information mapped to each of the 200 universities: Student Enrollment Size, Campus Setting, Campus Location, Public/Private, Academic Calendar, Admission Rate, Financial Aid, Tuition, Country Rank, University's Internal Schools. 

The recommendation algorithm is as follows: it takes the user's selections of enrollment size, campus setting, school status (public or private), the academic calendar system, the location (specifically state) and how they weight these preferences and outputs 3 schools that fit some of their criteria. It starts with the list of schools that are in their selection that they indicated as their most important preference, and slowly works down each preference until there is no overlap of schools. This algorithm is rooted in affiliation networks. Essentially each map represents an affiliation network where the schools are nodes that are connected to their specific affiliation. By getting which categories that the user prefers, it is essentially adding weights to these edges that influence the recommendation. The idea is based of "focal closure", that the user is more likely to be interested in a school because they share the same affilliation.
